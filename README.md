# Sorting Algorithms in Java

This project was developed as part of a university assignment to implement and analyze four fundamental sorting algorithms in Java.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Selection Sort**

### 1. Bubble Sort
A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, and repeats until the list is sorted.

### 2. Insertion Sort
Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.

### 3. Quick Sort
A divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot, partitions the array, and recursively sorts the subarrays.

### 4. Selection Sort
Finds the smallest element in the unsorted section and swaps it with the first unsorted element, repeating the process until sorted.
